/// Event Types
///
/// - fork: Triggered when a user forks a repository.
/// - commitComment: Triggered when a commit comment is created.
/// - create: Represents a created repository, branch, or tag.
/// - issueComment: Triggered when an issue comment is created, edited, or deleted.
/// - issues: Triggered when an issue is assigned, unassigned, labeled, unlabeled, opened, edited, milestoned, demilestoned, closed, or reopened.
/// - member: Triggered when a user accepts an invitation or is removed as a collaborator to a repository, or has their permissions changed.
/// - organizationBlock: Triggered when an organization blocks or unblocks a user.
/// - `public`: Triggered when a private repository is open sourced. Without a doubt: the best GitHub event.
/// - release: Triggered when a release is published.
/// - star: The WatchEvent is related to starring a repository, not watching.
